# HealthCare_Readmission
#Predicting patient readmission helps hospitals identify which patients might return within 30 days. First, we define the problem by setting the goal of predicting readmissions. Then,  collect data from patient records, including medical history and demographics. Next,  clean and prepare the data by handling missing values and formatting it properly. then analyze the data to find patterns and important factors affecting readmission. In feature engineering, i create useful data points like the number of past hospital visits. After that,  choose a model, such as logistic regression or random forest, and train it by splitting the data into training and testing sets.  then evaluate the model using accuracy and other performance measures. Once it’s performing well,  deploy it using tools like Flask to make real-time predictions. Finally, document the process for future improvements.
